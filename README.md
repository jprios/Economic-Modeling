Linear regression and Newton's method used to maximize production output

Given production data and budgetary guidelines, the goal of this project is to find quantities of input factors that maximize output. First, a production function is derived from the dataset, then a budget function is defined, then an optimization problem is framed with those functions and solved using Newton's method, and finally the solution of the optimization problem is evaluated as the optimal values of input factors.
